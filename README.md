This GitHub repository is dedicated to an academic project developed as part of the coursework at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, under the supervision of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The project, authored by Diogenis Tsichlakis, focuses on the fascinating world of non-linear structural dynamics, particularly examining the behavior of electric motor supports under non-linear forces. This exploration is driven by the curiosity to understand how mechanical systems react when subjected to conditions that deviate from the linear norm, such as Duffing-type stiffness and linear damping characteristics.

### Project Overview:

The essence of this study is to dissect and analyze the dynamical responses of a mechanical system - specifically, an electric motor and its support mechanism. By delving into the complexities of non-linear dynamics, the project aims to shed light on the frequency-response and phase-response under different conditions, including main resonance and the intriguing phenomenon of subharmonic resonance. The project takes a methodical approach by first undimensionalizing the system's differential equations, thereby simplifying the analysis and enabling the construction of amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency diagrams through numerical methods.

### What's Studied:

- **Differential Equation Undimensionalization:** Transforming the system's equations into dimensionless forms to streamline the analysis process.
- **Frequency and Phase Response:** Analyzing how the system responds to various frequencies and phases, focusing on main and subharmonic resonances.
- **Impact of Damping and Initial Conditions:** Investigating the effects of different damping measures and initial conditions on the system's dynamic behavior.
- **Non-linear Dynamics with Obstacles:** Introducing obstacles to study piecewise continuous characteristics and their influence on the system's response.
